# dblcmd

Generated this repo from https://doublecmd.sourceforge.io/

This is generated by going to their develop page: https://doublecmd.sourceforge.io/mediawiki/index.php/Development
Then, I used the directions on the develop page to get the current source from their svn server on or around 10/11/17 using git instead of svn(i.e., using the "git svn" command.  
Afterward, I continued by using free-pascal-compiler(fpc) and lazarus to confirm that the program would compile.  Finally, I uploaded to github on or around 10/13/17.  


This is originally meant for my personal use and anyone wanting the source code from the original developer at the sourceforge web site or other web sites listed above.

My personal use is to use this as a starting point for another project.
